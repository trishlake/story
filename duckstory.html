the little duck went out to the river, he(she) jump into the water, she was swimming around the lake, and she drink some water, she eat some worms but it would be nice if you can give them some bread, they love it, they can eat whatever they found, for example: small fish, fish eggs, snails, worms,slugs, mollusks, small crustaceans such as crayfish, and actually they can eat vegeable too. when i was a little my mum buy for me and my sister 3 little cutie duck. me and my family take care of them, i use to dig worm for them to eat, first they not trust me, but i keep doing it, finally they really love me, and they trust me, i give for them food and try to work out which one they like, and finally i feed them vegeable with some cook rice and water, and they love it, coz the duck love water, they want to swim to have fun with the water, so it would be nice if give them food in the water, but becareful, you dont want the lake will full of food or make the river become more dirty. so i think just give them a bowl of soft vegeble with a lot of water, i think they will love it.
