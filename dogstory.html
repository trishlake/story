My family used to have a dog at home. he(she) always protect our family from a naughty person. he(she) always be in front of the house at night time so we can sleep peaceful. He(she) will bark at a stranger or a thief want to come our house to rob something.(they) the Dog is really loyalty, trustful, and clever. i love them so much. They used to be my friend. They make me happy when i feel stress after doing a lot of works from school. And i have a lot fun with them when i teach them something and play games with them. My favorite dog is "gau", after" gau " died, my family and me always call the other dog after him is "gau". i miss him so much, even i rarely remember him much coz i was a little girl when my family have him.
